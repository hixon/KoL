# KoL
Tools and stuff for KoL

Testing out a simple way to map character inventory to a catalog that can be queried for specific information
Examples:
  - best outfits for prismatic damage
  - what will give me the most stench damage including potions
  - how many of a certain item do i have
  - best outfits for ferny's basement

## TODO
- create a class to hold each item that can be written to a JSON file to be used on a web front end
- figure out if there is anyway to do this without first manually saving each section from the web inspector and loading that
- host this somewhere so that anyone can use it from the KoL community
